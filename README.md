# Etch - a - Sketch

## Introduction

Making sketch board was very fun. I used a grid, since I think that is the easiest option to manipulate the board.  

You can color the boxes with a color of your choosing, you can pick black option or rainbow, where the colors are going to be added randomly. You can clear the board one by one or the whole board. One more option you have is to change the grid size from 1 box to 100. The boxes are getting colored on mouseover. 

I wanted to make the design quite similar to what etch-a-sketch actually looked like, this one is not mobile friendly, though.

## Improvements

I would like to make some more color options maybe to fade the color - opacity. And maybe add options to those buttons on the board.

## Technologies

Skills i used: 
- HTML, 
- CSS,
- JavaScript
